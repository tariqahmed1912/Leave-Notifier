# CBIT Hacktober Fest 
## Project - Leave Notifier

Team project for CBIT Hacktoberfest (2020). Developed a web application to ease the process of leave application for college faculty. Implemented Role-Based Access Control based on position of faculty; HOD or Staff. The lecturers can request for a leave by logging into the application and fill out a form stating the reason for leave and its duration. The HOD of the respective faculty's dept gets notified via email about the lecturers request. HOD can then log into the application and decide to accept or deny the request by referring the history of the lecturers leave requests (accepted/denied leaves).
